It's also a good opportunity to document the things you've accomplished throughout the year and set some loose goals for the next year."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"choosing-what-to-work-on-is-hard","categorySlug":"/category/engineering/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Choosing what to work on is hard","date":"2018-12-11T21:51:33.995Z","category":"engineering","description":"I hosted my friend yesterday for a dinner and we had a very interesting conversation around our work and how it evolves over time as you become a more mature engineer.

Having a full-time job and a family doesn’t give you too much free time so I better justify what I spend my time on. This thinking really changed my perspective on things that I was keen to work on. This article is a reflection of that journey."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer/","categorySlug":"/category/remote/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reflections on being a remote developer","date":"2018-11-11","category":"Remote","description":"It was the winter of 2016 when I opened my phone and saw the job offer from Buffer. I remember I was in an Uber with my wife driving back home from the JFK airport. So many things have changed since then. I grew as a person and as an engineer. This article is a story where I openly share all my learnings and challenges I’ve experienced throughout my journey of working remotely as a software engineer."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-i-acquired-my-first-10-customers-for-cronhub/","categorySlug":"/category/cronhub/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I acquired my first customers for Cronhub","date":"2018-08-27","category":"Cronhub","description":"My name is Tigran, I'm 29, and I'm the creator of Cronhub.

Cronhub is a cron monitoring tool for developers. It monitors and alerts you if any of your scheduled jobs fail or run longer than expected."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-price-your-side-project/","categorySlug":"/category/remote/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to price your side-project","date":"2018-06-06","category":"Remote","description":"If you had asked me a couple of months ago if I could ever write an article about pricing, it probably would have made me laugh.\nUntil a few months agao, I didn’t know anything about product pricing even though I’d launched my first SaaS project. The way I priced my product was by solely relying on my own intuition, as well as looking at how other similar SaaS products priced their services. I think this is what most beginners do."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":0,"postsLimit":10,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}
