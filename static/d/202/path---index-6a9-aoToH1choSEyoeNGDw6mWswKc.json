It's always interesting to look back and reflect on the past year. It's also a good opportunity to document the things you've accomplished throughout the year and set some loose goals for the next year."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"choosing-what-to-work-on-is-hard","categorySlug":"/category/engineering/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Choosing what to work on is hard","date":"2018-12-11T21:51:33.995Z","category":"engineering","description":"I hosted my friend yesterday for a dinner and we had a very interesting conversation around our work and how it evolves over time as you become a more mature engineer.

This article is a reflection of that journey."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer/","categorySlug":"/category/remote/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reflections on being a remote developer","date":"2018-11-11","category":"Remote","description":"It was the winter of 2016 when I opened my phone and saw the job offer from Buffer. I remember I was in an Uber with my wife driving back home from the JFK airport. So many things have changed since then. I grew as a person and as an engineer. This article is a story where I openly share all my learnings and challenges I’ve experienced throughout my journey of working remotely as a software engineer."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":0,"postsLimit":5,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}}
