Cronhub is a <g class=\"gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" id=\"21\" data-gr-id=\"21\">cron</g> monitoring tool for developers.

Finding the first customers is probably the hardest challenge for every product maker in early stages. This explains why so many people are curious how others managed to find their first customers and read their stories.&nbsp;<br><br>In this article, I want to share my story and experience of acquiring my first paid customers after launching my side-project. It’s been a fun and interesting journey full of joy and challenges. I hope I can shed some light on this process and inspire other developers to find their own path by reading my story.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Working on Cronhub</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having a full-time job and trying to build an online business on the side is challenging. The biggest challenge is being very organized with your time and not burning yourself out. Apart from my full-time job at Buffer I usually work on Cronhub 1-2 hours on weekdays and maybe 5-6 hours on the weekends. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I try to get 8-hours sleep each day otherwise I feel tired the next day which really hurts my productivity. &nbsp;Of course, there are some days when I feel down but I know it’s just temporary and I have to wait for the fog to lift.&nbsp;<br><br>Even though Cronhub is a side-business I pay a lot of attention to prioritize the tasks. I group all my tasks into two high-level buckets.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Tasks that will improve the product and make customers happy (product work)</li><li>Tasks that will bring more visitors by increasing the awareness of the site (marketing work)</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is also the other aspect that improves the activation of the product like creating and activating a Cronhub monitor but I keep it in the product bucket just for the sake of simplicity. The challenge here is finding the sweet spot where you balance the two buckets. Being an engineer I’m naturally more inclined to prioritize more product work but I’m deliberately practicing to overcome this bias.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Current numbers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Currently, I have 7-10 sign-ups daily. Most of the visitors come from my past blog post articles that are not necessarily my target audience. However, content marketing has been the only marketing channel that I’ve used with Cronhub. No cold emails or ads.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here are some metrics that I thought could be interesting to share.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:subhead -->\n<p class=\"wp-block-subhead\">Product and Financial Metrics<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:subhead -->\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Cronhub has around ~1100 signed up users</li><li>450 active monitors making around 130,000 pings daily. A monitor is active if it has received at least one ping from an external job or script (e.g. your daily database backup job, weekly digest email job)</li><li>Only in the last 3 weeks, Cronhub reported around 3000 <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">cron</g> job failures to our users. The failure can be either that job failed to run on schedule or ran longer than expected.&nbsp;<br></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Net Revenue since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cronhub\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the launch day</a> is $710 (actual total gross revenue minus any fees, refunds, disputes)</li><li>Trial conversion rate 83% (I expect this number will go down eventually)</li><li>Monthly expenses, $57</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My expenses haven’t changed since the launch day and I plan to keep it as low as possible.&nbsp;<br><br>Something I didn’t expect at all is seeing almost half of my customers choosing the yearly billing plan over monthly. I don’t know if I should make some conclusions here but I may if I see this pattern repeats when I gain more customers and data points.&nbsp;<br><br>One thing I’m very proud of but still plan to improve is Cronhub's SEO score. &nbsp;It’s really cool to see a big chunk of my visitors coming from organic search especially for an early product like Cronhub. I think it’s a great validation for me to continue focusing on SEO and improving the organic growth.<br><br>Apart from the basic SEO techniques (like keywords, fast page load, etc) and writing content on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.cronhub.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cronhub’s blog</a> I haven’t done anything else. I’ll talk more about this a bit later.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Acquiring my first customers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I launched Cronhub I could only dream about having 10 customers and now when I’m here it seems like I’ve so much yet to cover. Getting my first paid customer was very crucial for the product. I spent a couple of months building the MVP (minimal viable product) and I wanted to see the returns of my hard work. Also, I think having a product that people pay for is a great way to validate your idea and know that you’re onto something.<br><br>I was very lucky to get my first ever customer signing up for the “<a href=\"https://cronhub.io/pricing\">Developer ($7)</a>” plan the next day after the launch. At that time I only had one paid plan on Cronhub but getting the Stripe notification of having a new customer was something special. It immediately boosted my confidence and pushed my motivation to the roof.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Later on, this customer switched to the business plan because he and his team needed more monitors. However, when he emailed me the “Business” plan was still on “Coming soon” phase but I told him that I’d upgrade him within the next couple of days and I did. I made it my top priority and had him on the business plan next week.<br><br>For the business plan, I had to build team member support from scratch but it was worth it because I knew I had to support teams on Cronhub anyway. Cronhub is primarily built for developer teams so team invitation and management support was a&nbsp;no-brainer. It was just a matter of time.<br><br>I manually upgraded the customer and offered a lifetime discount on the business plan. I’m always in touch with my first customer and he has been very helpful with providing valuable feedback.<br><br>So my first customer came from the Product Hunt launch, however, it took me 2 weeks to get two more customers and both within the same week. After the launch obviously the number of visitors went down so I had to think about ways to promote Cronhub. I really didn’t think for too long here and decided to do what I enjoy the most, write.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I really love writing. I think of writing as a way of meditating. It helps me to stay focused on one thing which is not always possible with my monkey brain. I knew I could write about my experience of building Cronhub as an online business which I’ve been doing ever since.&nbsp;<br><br>Writing helped me to grow my audience as well as market Cronhub. After starting to write I started to grow my Twitter follower as well. Below is the graph that illustrates the evolution of my Twitter followers after I started blogging regularly. I think you can see the breaking point!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"wide\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_463B5B843C808EC567696389CB0E09BF6A18243425A5174DFBB47067DD0D878A_1535238962842_Image+2018-08-25+at+7.15.14+PM.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>I started writing regularly in March and you can see how my audience grew ever since</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>When I decided to make content as my primary marketing channel I started a blog with a new subdomain <a href=\"https://blog.cronhub.io\">blog.cronhub.io</a>. With the new blog, my intention was to squeeze all the SEO benefits. Since I wanted to improve the SEO score to get more organic visitors I dedicated a week or so to make Cronhub more SEO optimized. There are many resources covering the basics which you can find on the web.<br><br>One example of how my site optimization and content writing helped on the SEO side is this screenshot from Google Analytics showing that almost 40% of my traffic on August 23-24 came from organic search. This percentage fluctuates between 20% - 40% every day. I think it’s great and I have to keep the spirit high. It would be great to know what the industry average is for SaaS products.<br><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"wide\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img src=\"https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_463B5B843C808EC567696389CB0E09BF6A18243425A5174DFBB47067DD0D878A_1535240789357_Image+2018-08-24+at+10.24.57+AM.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>The Organic Search was the top acquisition channel for these days</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I publish all my articles on Cronhub’s blog first and then I republish them on Medium and <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com\">Indie Hackers</a>.

As an example, If I had to write an article about<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Kubernetes Cron Jobs</a> and how they work I’d expect that most of my readers know at least what <g class=\"gr_ gr_45 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" id=\"45\" data-gr-id=\"45\">cron</g> jobs are. I want to narrow down the scope of my articles and target to more relevant developers. What I care most is not the number of visitors but the type of visitors. I have a couple of ideas and excited to see how they perform in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>After having three paying customers within the first month I was very pumped when I got my first yearly “Developer” plan customer in early May. It was around the time when I started to read and learn more about product pricing. I knew nothing about pricing but I was keen to learn.<br><br>I talked to product managers and people who understood SaaS pricing model better than I did (btw I wrote <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.cronhub.io/how-i-priced-my-side-project/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an entire article</a> where I share all my learnings on pricing). Then, I changed my pricing table and added a new intermediate plan called “Startup”. It was in-between “Developer ($7)” and “Business ($49)” plans because I thought the pricing gap between these two plans were too high.&nbsp;<br><br>I changed the pricing and to my big surprise my next customer signed up for the yearly “Startup” plan. It felt really good. I felt like that soccer manager who brings a substitute player to the field and that player scores a goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I started to slowly acquire new customers until I got to the first sweet spot, 10 paying customers. <br><br>However, looking back it did take me almost 5 months until I got my first 10 customers. This is me being a solo founder working around 10-15 hours per week. <br><br>It’s been a slow journey and, of course, there are times when you don’t have a single new customer in the span of multiple weeks and you feel terrible with lack of motivation. But I know these things will pass and I’m excited more than ever to get to my 100 customers.<br><br>If I reflect on my past journey I can certainly say that there is no universal formula that one can use to succeed in this process. However, I believe that patience is the biggest player. You have to believe in yourself and be patient.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>If I could make a list of my main learnings&nbsp;it would be this.&nbsp;</strong><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Focus on the core product and user experience in the beginning.&nbsp;</li><li>Do not spend too much time thinking about your pricing in your early days.
