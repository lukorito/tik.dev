I remember I was in an Uber with my wife driving back home from the JFK airport. So many things have changed since then. I grew as a person and as an engineer. This article is a story where I openly share all my learnings and challenges I’ve experienced throughout my journey of working remotely as a software engineer."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-i-acquired-my-first-10-customers-for-cronhub/","categorySlug":"/category/cronhub/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I acquired my first customers for Cronhub","date":"2018-08-27","category":"Cronhub","description":"My name is Tigran, I'm 29, and I'm the creator of Cronhub.

The way I priced my product was by solely relying on my own intuition, as well as looking at how other similar SaaS products priced their services. I think this is what most beginners do."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":1,"postsLimit":10,"postsOffset":10,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}}
