Buffer is a remote company with no office. I‚Äôve been working remotely for almost four years now and learned a lot about remote work. Last year I wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/free-code-camp/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer-757465ed1e9e\">popular article</a> where I shared my reflections on being a remote developer. In my free time, I like playing soccer, writing, and working on my <a href=\"https://cronhub.io\">side-project</a>.</p>\n<figure><a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/97f0b/tigran-hawaii.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 960px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Tigran in Kauai\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/d564d/tigran-hawaii.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/865fd/tigran-hawaii.jpg 240w,\n/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/d40a0/tigran-hawaii.jpg 480w,\n/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/d564d/tigran-hawaii.jpg 960w,\n/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/c67c1/tigran-hawaii.jpg 1440w,\n/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/667be/tigran-hawaii.jpg 1920w,\n/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/85f07/tigran-hawaii.jpg 2880w,\n/static/0d3c7274796a8c5867d31ceaae4710d9/97f0b/tigran-hawaii.jpg 4032w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\">\n  </span>\n  </a><figcaption>This year I traveled to Kauai island and worked from there.

I hope I can help and share everything I know and learned about remote work. I know it‚Äôs a significant lifestyle change when you decide to work remotely, and I hope to help even a little to ease that decision.</p>\n<h2>Who should attend?</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôm a developer, and I base my remote experience on the type of work I do every day. Knowing what I know, I think I can be the most helpful to people who are in tech and especially developers.</p>\n<p>Here is a group of people that I have in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developers who are not sure whether remote work will be a good fit for them</li>\n<li>Developers who work remotely and want to be better at it</li>\n<li>Developers who want to find a remote job</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What‚Äôs the structure of the ‚ÄúOffice Hours‚Äù?</h2>\n<p>Please introduce yourself first. Like any other ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù I expect you to come with your questions and I‚Äôll try to answer them the best I can.</p>\n<h2>How do I sign up?</h2>\n<p>You can grab an available time slot on my <strong><a href=\"https://calendly.com/tigranh/remote-work-office-hours-with-tigran\">Calendly schedule</a></strong>. <strong>All calls will be video calls on <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a></strong>. <strong>Please make sure you downloaded and installed Zoom prior our calls</strong>. The meeting link will be in the calendar invite.</p>\n<h2>How much time do I have?</h2>\n<p>I want to keep it for 20 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Are you doing this by yourself?</h2>\n<p>Yes. However, I might have surprise guests on some days.</p>\n<h2>Do I have to pay for this?</h2>\n<p>No. It‚Äôs completely free.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tag/remote/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-08-25","description":"Today I‚Äôm excited to announce my new initiative - Remote Work ‚ÄúOffice Hours.‚Äù I will be dedicating 2-3 hours every week (20 min time slots) to answer your questions about working remotely as a developer.
