I think the way we’re building software now is going to change in the future fundamentally. With the rise of cloud technology, all the tools we use now might move to the cloud. This transition makes me think if the next significant innovation in programming languages connects to cloud innovation.</p>\n<p>Can we build a new programming language that runs on the cloud? Why do we have to duplicate the same codebase in our local machine and the cloud? Do we need the tools like git to keep them in sync? Can we remove the friction between the code that engineers write and the production release? I have more questions buried in my head that make me thrilled to see what the future has to surprise us.</p>\n<p>Today, I want to share my quick thoughts about Kubernetes and why I think it’s an exciting technology for our ecosystem and the future of building software.</p>\n<h2>The infrastructure becomes more innovative and less scary</h2>\n<p>I know how intimidating infrastructure and DevOps type of work is for most developers, particularly for people who are entering the field. I think even experienced engineers sometimes struggle to wrap their heads around deployments, servers, networking, and more. I’m optimistic we can eradicate the complexity of infrastructure by building high-level abstractions on top of Kubernetes. We still need to build backend services, but it won’t be hard anymore because using the agility of Kubernetes, we can make more visual and user-friendly tools. We can treat infrastructure as LEGO and construct anything we want by combining different bricks. Instead of writing long bash scripts or server receipts to provision servers, we can build visual editors in the cloud that allow us to create backend services and make complex pipelines.</p>\n<h2>Far more people become makers</h2>\n<p>Less than 1% of the world’s population currently knows how to write software. Does one have to know how to code to make things for computers? I don’t think so. We now have no-code tools that we can use to make websites and software. No-code tools are very promising because they empower more people to become makers from diverse backgrounds. We want more creators and entrepreneurs for world innovation and good.</p>\n<p>At this point, most of the no-code tools are designed to reduce the obstacles for frontend development and automation tools. I want to see such tools for building complicated backend services too. It’s still a pain to write, deploy, and scale backend infrastructures. With the help of Kubernetes, we can address this challenge. We can build no-code tools that run on Kubernetes. Creating, scaling, and rolling back backend services won’t be stressful anymore. We can finally not feel guilty for Friday deploys.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>Once a month or so, I send out an email with my latest writing, thoughts, or anything interesting that I’ve read. <a href=\"https://tinyletter.com/tigranh\">Sign up for my newsletter</a>.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tag/kubernetes/","/tag/cloud/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-10-26","description":"I believe Kubernetes is a lot more than software to manage containerized applications.
