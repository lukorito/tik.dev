I’m Tigran. I’m a software engineer at Buffer. I’m very passionate about building tools that enable people to learn and create in new ways. In my free time, I try to read, write and play soccer.</p>\n<p>Here are some other things about me that you might want to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m originally from Armenia and have an MSc in Computer Science from <a href=\"https://rit.edu\">RIT</a>. I’ve specialized in Distributed Systems and Databases.</li>\n<li>I’m the creator of <a href=\"https://cronhub.io\">Cronhub</a>. Cronhub is a cron monitoring tool for developers. It’s my side-business and I share my learnings on <a href=\"https://blog.cronhub.io\">this blog</a>.</li>\n<li>In 2016 I built <a href=\"https://booknshelf.com\">Booknshelf</a> to help people to keep track of their books online. Since I love reading books, I thought this would be a fun project to work on.</li>\n<li>I was a graduate teaching assistant at RIT teaching Computer Science I, II to undergrads. The curriculum included the basics of computer science, data structures, and algorithms.</li>\n<li>When I was at RIT I built an online carpooling platform for students called Wheelie. It was my first side-project. It became the official carpooling platform for RIT students. However, I shut it down in 2016 for personal reasons.</li>\n<li>I had a summer internship at Twitter NYC in 2014. I worked at the geo team building location-based backend services.</li>\n<li>I served in mandatory military service in Armenia for two years. I actually liked it because I had so much free time to read books. I read mostly fiction in Armenian and Russian. Of course, I read <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky\">Dostoevsky</a>’s most notable books as one should.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}
