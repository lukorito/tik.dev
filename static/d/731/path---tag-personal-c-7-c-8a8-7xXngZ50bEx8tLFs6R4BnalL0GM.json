It's also a good opportunity to document the things you've accomplished throughout the year and set some loose goals for the next year."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/reflections-on-being-a-side-business","categorySlug":"/category/personal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reflections on building a side-business","date":"2018-12-05","category":"Personal","description":"For the past year or so I’ve started to value my time a lot and decided if I ever get involved in side-projects it won’t be for free. Having a full-time job and a family doesn’t give you too much free time so I better justify what I spend my time on. This thinking really changed my perspective on things that I was keen to work on. This article is a reflection of that journey."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer/","categorySlug":"/category/remote/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reflections on being a remote developer","date":"2018-11-11","category":"Remote","description":"It was the winter of 2016 when I opened my phone and saw the job offer from Buffer.

The way I priced my product was by solely relying on my own intuition, as well as looking at how other similar SaaS products priced their services. I think this is what most beginners do."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Personal","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":10,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/personal","nextPagePath":"/tag/personal/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}
