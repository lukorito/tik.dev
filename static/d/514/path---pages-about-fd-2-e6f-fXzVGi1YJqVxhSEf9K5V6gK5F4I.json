Iâ€™m particularly excited about developer productivity and enjoy thinking about systems and tools that improve developersâ€™ workflow. In my free time, I enjoy writing, reading and playing soccer. My wife keeps telling me that I should have become a writer, but I think programming and writing have so much in common that I donâ€™t have to regret my choice. :)</p>\n<p>Here are some other things about me that you might want to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iâ€™m originally from Armenia and have an MSc in Computer Science from RIT.</li>\n<li>Iâ€™m the creator of <a href=\"https://cronhub.io\">Cronhub</a>. Cronhub is a cron monitoring tool for developers. Itâ€™s my side-business and I share my learnings on <a href=\"https://blog.cronhub.io\">this blog</a>.</li>\n<li>Iâ€™ve created <a href=\"https://booknshelf.com\">Booknshelf</a>  to help people to keep track of their books online. Since I love reading books I thought this would be a fun project to work on.</li>\n<li>I was a graduate teaching assistant at RIT teaching Computer Science I, II to undergrads. The curriculum included the basics of computer science, data structures, and algorithms.</li>\n<li>When I was at RIT I built an online carpooling platform for students called Wheelie. It was my first real side-project. It became the official carpooling platform for RIT students. However, I shut it down in 2016 for personal reasons.</li>\n<li>I had a summer internship at Twitter NYC in 2014. I worked at the geo team building location-based backend services.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}
