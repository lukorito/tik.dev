Having a full-time job and a family doesn’t give you too much free time so I better justify what I spend my time on. This thinking really changed my perspective on things that I was keen to work on. This article is a reflection of that journey."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-i-acquired-my-first-10-customers-for-cronhub/","categorySlug":"/category/cronhub/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I acquired my first customers for Cronhub","date":"2018-08-27","category":"Cronhub","description":"My name is Tigran, I'm 29, and I'm the creator of Cronhub.
