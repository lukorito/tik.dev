**UPDATE August 27, 2019: I'm pausing the office hours due to the demand. I don't want to go too far in the calendar. I will resume when I finish the calls in this cycle. Thanks for understanding! :)**

Today I‚Äôm excited to announce my new initiative - Remote Work ‚ÄúOffice Hours.‚Äù I will be dedicating 2-3 hours every week (20 min time slots) to answer your questions about working remotely as a developer. It‚Äôs completely free and aims to help everyone who wants to learn more about remote work.


## Who am I?
My name is [Tigran](https://tik.dev), and I‚Äôm a software engineer at [Buffer](https://buffer.com). Buffer is a remote company with no office. I‚Äôve been working remotely for almost four years now and learned a lot about remote work. Last year I wrote a [popular article](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer-757465ed1e9e) where I shared my reflections on being a remote developer. In my free time, I like playing soccer, writing, and working on my [side-project](https://cronhub.io).

## Why ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù?
After writing my article about remote work, I started to receive many emails asking questions about my experience of being a remote developer. I hope I can help and share everything I know and learned about remote work. I know it‚Äôs a significant lifestyle change when you decide to work remotely, and I hope to help even a little to ease that decision.


## Who should attend?
I‚Äôm a developer, and I base my remote experience on the type of work I do every day. Knowing what I know, I think I can be the most helpful to people who are in tech and especially developers.

Here is a group of people that I have in mind:
- Developers who are not sure whether remote work will be a good fit for them
- Developers who work remotely and want to be better at it
- Developers who want to find a remote job


## What‚Äôs the structure of the ‚ÄúOffice Hours‚Äù?
Please introduce yourself first. Like any other ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù I expect you to come with your questions and I‚Äôll try to answer them the best I can.


## How do I sign up?
You can grab an available time slot on my **[Calendly schedule](https://calendly.com/tigranh/remote-work-office-hours-with-tigran)**. **All calls will be video calls on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)**. **Please make sure you downloaded and installed Zoom prior our calls**. The meeting link will be in the calendar invite.


## How much time do I have?
I want to keep it for 20 minutes.


## Are you doing this by yourself?
Yes. However, I might have surprise guests on some days.


## Do I have to pay for this?
No. It‚Äôs completely free.
